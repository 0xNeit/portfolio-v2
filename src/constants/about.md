# Intro

I am a full stack Web3 developer. I build Decentralized applications using modern programming languages/libraries/frameworks/tools like Javascript/TypeScript, ReactJS, NextJS, Vite, Solidity, Rust, Move and Sway. I have built several DApps on chains such as Ethereum and other EVM Chains, Solana, Aptos, Sui, Movement, Venom and Fuel network. I am a self-taught developer and I like to learn new skills everyday. I have 5 years of experience building dApps(Web3) and about 8 years general coding experience.
